Agenda
------

* Presentation of RSE concept by Ralph

  Document will be distributed per eMail

  * Structure: RSE : Protocol : SubType
  * Central repository for RSE information --> Rucio Information Service?
  * http-error codes -> Mapping needed
  * Authentication to storage

* Scope and sub-scopes

  Proposal: No real hierarchy, just multiple scopes
    e.g. prod-repro14
         prod-repro13 ...
         
* Transfer-requests for subscriptions

  Wasn't clear to everyone, will write it down and distribute by eMail
* Migration

  We should discuss (in the near future) how we want to migrate the data
  Good preparation for this could even result in almost no migration effort at
  all
  
* Hierarchical namespace

  Add this functionality? At least keep it in mind
